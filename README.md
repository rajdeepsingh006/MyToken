# Project Title

Creating a Token using Solidity

## Description

In this code we have created a token that has a specific name,abbreviation and supply.
We can also mint and burn the token that we have created.


## Getting Started

First of all we have decleared three public variables TokenName,TokenAbbr and TotalSupply that contains name of the token,abbreviation of the token and 
total supply of the token respectively.

After that we have mapped address to an unsigned integer that will store the Balance of tokens in an address. 

Then, we have created two functions namely mint and burn function.The mint function is used to add tokens to a given address and the burn function is used to deduct tokens from a given address.
